# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Forked the 100 Days of Code repo, and edited it accordingly.
* Created a new repo for my CMMC Assessment Tool conversion.
* Learned how to format Markdown, and created a proper README.md for the repo.
* Finished the Codecademy course "Learn Python: Inheritance and Polymorphism".

**Thoughts**
* Although I understand Markdown is supposed to be simplistic, the inability to use multiple spaces while formatting text is rather frustrating.

**Link to work**
* [CMMC Assessment Tool's README.md](https://github.com/StingzLD/CMMC_Assessment_Tool/blob/master/README.md)
* [Learn Python: Inheritance and Polymorphism](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-classes)

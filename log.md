# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Forked the 100 Days of Code repo, and edited it accordingly.
* Created a new repo for my CMMC Assessment Tool conversion.
* Learned how to format Markdown, and created a proper README.md for the repo.
* Finished the Codecademy course "Learn Python: Inheritance and Polymorphism".

**Thoughts**
* Although I understand Markdown is supposed to be simplistic, the inability to use multiple spaces while formatting text is rather frustrating.

### Day 1: March 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Walked through Object Oriented Programming tutorials on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp), and went through their exercises. 
* Reset and went through the [Learn Python 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-classes) Codecademy lesson again.

**Thoughts**
* The reason for finding additional tutorials and resetting the Codecademy lesson is because it simply was not clicking last night. I was able to complete the lesson by following the examples in the instructions, but there were parts that my tired brain was just not comprehending. Now that I am going through everything with a fresh brain, everything is clicking.

### Day 1.5: March 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* See "Thoughts"

**Thoughts**
* Decided to spend time researching more about OOP to deepen my understanding before continuing on.

* No coding performed today.

### Day 2: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the [Learn Python 3: Classes](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-classes) Codecademy project.

**Thoughts**
* I seem to be in a limbo state where I understand the concept, I can create class structures and objects based off of them without issue, but I still have that feeling that I am missing something. Based off of this project, I really have no reason to feel that way. Perhaps it is because I am still being fed the information like the class names, parameters, etc., so I have not actually had to create everything from scratch-scratch yet, even though I was able to write all of the code in this project without assistance.

### Day 3: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Worked through most of the [Learn Python 3: Function Arguments](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/learn-python-function-arguments) Codecademy lesson.

**Thoughts**
* A lot of this lesson seemed to be just repeat material from earlier in the course with a twist, until the later lessons. There was not a lot of writing code, though, mainly just reading the explanations in the lessons (a lot of text to read in these lessons), going through the code, and find things to change. Not necessarily a bad thing, per se, but I was expecting the final lesson of the course to be much more jam packed with coding.

### Day 4: March 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Finished the [Learn Python 3: Function Arguments](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/learn-python-function-arguments) Codecademy lesson.
* Completed the [Learn Python 3: Function Arguments](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/learn-python-function-arguments) Codecademy project.
* Completed the [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) Codecademy class!!!

**Thoughts**
* The rest of the Function Arguments' lessons taught some very good ways to process code, as well as minimize the amount of code needing to be written.
* I am SO HAPPY that I have now completed the Learn Python 3 course from Codecademy!!! The question is, where do I want to go from here? I need to get work done on my CMMC Assessment Tool conversion side project, but there are also a couple of courses on freeCodeCamp that I want to pursue, specifically [Information Security](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/) and [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/). My current job is IT security, and I have been really wanting to get into using Python for scripting changes to the infrastructure, so that seems like the logical next step. What better way to build Python knowledge than while building tools to help with my job. On the flipside, I really want to start exploring data analysis with Numpy, Pandas, etc. Ultimately, I think both courses are going to be highly beneficial, as parsing through data collected in CSVs from multiple programs and making sense of it all is also a big part of my job.

### Day 5: March 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the following [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) Code Challenges: Control Flow, Control Flow (Advanced), Lists, Lists (Advanced).

**Thoughts**
* After completing the course yesterday, I noticed that there were two new sections in the course: Python Code Challenges and Python Code Challenges II. Naturally, I decided to take these on! After all, who am I to turn down a challenge. I mean, that is exactly how I ended up doing the 100DaysOfCode challenge in the first place! Sadly, though, the challenges were not very challenging so far, even the "advanced" ones.  Granted, there is only so complicated control flow and manipulating lists can get within the context of the course, but they still seemed a bit too easy. Up next are challenges for loops and functions, so hopefully those be more of a brain teaser.

### Day 6: March 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the following [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) Code Challenges: Loops, Loops (Advanced), Functions, and Functions (Advanced).

**Thoughts**
* Although most of the challenges were of the same difficulty (or lack thereof) as yesterday, there was one in the Loops (Advanced) that actually caused me to think about how I would go about doing it, as I had to recall the ways a certain function behaved that I have not used for a little while. Overall, though, it was good practice to refresh my brain on lessons learned earlier in the course that were not used much in later lessons.

### Day 6.5: March 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Watched a few videos from freeCodeCamp on YouTube.

**Thoughts**
* Due to some personal reasons, I was not in a mindset that would allow me to really focus on coding today. However, I did at least spend some time watching related videos.

* None

### Day 7: March 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the following [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) Code Challenges: Strings, Strings (Advanced).

**Thoughts**
* These challenges were a good refresher on functions I have not fully utilized since originally learning them.

### Day 8: March 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the remaining [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) Code Challenges: Dictionaries, Dictionaries (Advanced), Classes, Classes (Advanced).

**Thoughts**
* The remaining challenges were pretty low in difficulty, like the others, with the exception of Classes (Advanced). The only reason I say this, however, is because Codecademy had flaws in their instructions, so I had to figure out what exactly the tests were looking for then figure out how to change the code to reflect that. In that regard, it made it slightly more challenging, but it was also good practice in debugging using a test result.
* I also had my first big issue with Git today. I work on multiple machines, and I have the repos cloned on all of them. Tonight, I made a commit without first pulling, which then showed the commit message as merging. Considering this is not what I wanted, I wanted to undo the commit. I found that to do this you have to do a "git reset --hard HEAD~1", which I did, but it did not undo the merge it created when I pulled everything down. I decided to run it again to get rid of that, as that was the only commit still showing up for today, and although it got rid of that merge, it actually got rid of the previous commit as well! Luckily, I backed up my files before doing anything, so I just put those back in and made a new commit, but now my commit history is missing a commit, which makes it look like I did nothing that day. Ugh... Lesson learned. BE CAUTIOUS WHEN DOING A HARD RESET!!!

### Day 9: March 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed [Information Security with HelmetJS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-with-helmetjs/) on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**
* Admittedly, this took me a bit to initally figure out, as I had to look up JS syntax on top of HelmetJS and BCrypt because I have not learned any of those yet. Nonetheless, I was able to successfully complete the challenges, which ended up being fairly easy once working with basic JS was no longer an issue. That being said, I am sure I will probably have to go back and look at the HelmetJS and BCrypt doucmentation in the future to refresh on how to configure and use the packages, but it is fairly straightforward once you have the information in front of you.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Forked the 100 Days of Code repo, and edited it accordingly.
* Created a new repo for my CMMC Assessment Tool conversion.
* Learned how to format Markdown, and created a proper README.md for the repo.
* Finished the Codecademy course "Learn Python: Inheritance and Polymorphism".

**Thoughts**
* Although I understand Markdown is supposed to be simplistic, the inability to use multiple spaces while formatting text is rather frustrating.

### Day 1: March 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Walked through Object Oriented Programming tutorials on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp), and went through their exercises. 
* Reset and went through the [Learn Python 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-classes) Codecadmey lesson again.

**Thoughts**
* The reason for finding additional tutorials and resetting the Codecademy lesson is because it simply was not clicking last night. I was able to complete the lesson by following the examples in the instructions, but there were parts that my tired brain was just not comprehending. Now that I am going through everything with a fresh brain, everything is clicking.

### Day 1.5: March 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* See "Thoughts"

**Thoughts**
* Decided to spend time researching more about OOP to deepen my understanding before continuing on.

* No coding performed today.

### Day 2: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Completed the [Learn Python 3: Classes](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-classes) Codecademy project.

**Thoughts**
* I seem to be in a limbo state where I understand the concept, I can create class structures and objects based off of them without issue, but I still have that feeling that I am missing something. Based off of this project, I really have no reason to feel that way. Perhaps it is because I am still being fed the information like the class names, parameters, etc., so I have not actually had to create everything from scratch-scratch yet, even though I was able to write all of the code in this project without assistance.

### Day 3: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Worked through most of the [Learn Python 3: Function Arguments](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/learn-python-function-arguments) Codecademy lesson.

**Thoughts**
* A lot of this lesson seemed to be just repeat material from earlier in the course with a twist, until the later lessons. There was not a lot of writing code, though, mainly just reading the explanations in the lessons (a lot of text to read in these lessons), going through the code, and find things to change. Not necessarily a bad thing, per se, but I was expecting the final lesson of the course to be much more jam packed with coding.

### Day 4: March 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Finished the [Learn Python 3: Function Arguments](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/learn-python-function-arguments) Codecademy lesson.
* Completed the [Learn Python 3: Function Arguments](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-python-3/lessons/learn-python-function-arguments) Codecademy project.
* Completed the [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) Codecademy class!!!

**Thoughts**
* The rest of the Function Arguments' lessons taught some very good ways to process code, as well as minimize the amount of code needing to be written.
* I am SO HAPPY that I have now completed the Learn Python 3 course from Codecademy!!! The question is, where do I want to go from here? I need to get work done on my CMMC Assessment Tool conversion side project, but there are also a couple of courses on freeCodeCamp that I want to pursue, specifically [Information Security](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/) and [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/). My current job is IT security, and I have been really wanting to get into using Python for scripting changes to the infrastructure, so that seems like the logical next step. What better way to build Python knowledge than while building tools to help with my job. On the flipside, I really want to start exploring data analysis with Numpy, Pandas, etc. Ultimately, I think both courses are going to be highly beneficial, as parsing through data collected in CSVs from multiple programs and making sense of it all is also a big part of my job.

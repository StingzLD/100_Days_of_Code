# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Forked the 100 Days of Code repo, and edited it accordingly.
* Created a new repo for my CMMC Assessment Tool conversion.
* Learned how to format Markdown, and created a proper README.md for the repo.
* Finished the Codecademy course "Learn Python: Inheritance and Polymorphism".

**Thoughts**
* Although I understand Markdown is supposed to be simplistic, the inability to use multiple spaces while formatting text is rather frustrating.

### Day 1: March 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**
* Walked through Object Oriented Programming tutorials on [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp), and went through their exercises. 
* Reset and went through the [Learn Python: Inheritance and Polymorphism](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-classes) Codecadmey lesson again.

**Thoughts**
* The reason for finding additional tutorials and resetting the Codecademy lesson is because it simply was not clicking last night. I was able to complete the lesson by following the examples in the instructions, but there were parts that my tired brain was just not comprehending. Now that I am going through everything with a fresh brain, everything is clicking.
